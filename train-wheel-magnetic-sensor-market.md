<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Train Wheel Magnetic Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Railway Wheel Sensor</li><li>Active Railway Wheel Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The train wheel magnetic sensor market is categorized into two main types: passive railway wheel sensors and active railway wheel sensors. Passive railway wheel sensors rely on external magnetic fields to detect wheel movement and position, requiring no power source, thus being cost-effective and low-maintenance. In contrast, active railway wheel sensors generate their own magnetic fields to operate, offering enhanced accuracy and real-time monitoring capabilities, but they typically involve higher installation and operating costs. Both types play crucial roles in railway safety and efficiency.</p></p>
