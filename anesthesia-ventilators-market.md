<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anesthesia Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Pressure Mechanical Ventilation</li><li>Negative Pressure Mechanical Ventilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anesthesia ventilators market primarily encompasses positive pressure mechanical ventilation and negative pressure mechanical ventilation. Positive pressure mechanical ventilation delivers breaths by pushing air into the lungs, making it crucial for surgical procedures requiring general anesthesia. In contrast, negative pressure mechanical ventilation operates by creating a negative pressure around the thoracic cavity, aiding in lung expansion and drawing air in without direct airway pressure, typically used for patients with specific respiratory conditions. Together, these technologies cater to diverse clinical needs.</p></p>
