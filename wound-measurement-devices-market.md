<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wound Measurement Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-Contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wound measurement devices can be categorized into two main types: contact and non-contact. Contact type devices involve physical contact with the wound, utilizing tools like rulers or digital devices that measure dimensions directly on the wound surface. These are often used for precise measurements and assessing healing. In contrast, non-contact type devices use imaging technology, such as infrared or laser scanning, to measure wounds without touching them. This approach minimizes the risk of infection and provides accurate assessments while enhancing patient comfort.</p></p>
